# 📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Workflow

## 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from loading and exploring raw data in Python, cleaning and transforming the dataset, running SQL queries for deeper insights, and finally visualizing results using Power BI.

A final report and presentation were created using **Gamma** to summarize findings for business stakeholders.

This project highlights practical skills in:
- Data wrangling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- SQL querying (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)  
- Dashboard design  
- Insight communication
